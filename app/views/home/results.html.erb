            You got a score of zero? Don’t worry -- it’s a good thing! It sounds like your relationship is on a pretty
            healthy track. Maintaining healthy relationships takes some work -- keep it up! Remember that while you
            may have a healthy relationship, it’s possible that a friend of yours does not. If you know someone who is in
            an abusive relationship, find out how you can help them by visiting loveisrespect.org.

    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p class="btn btn-xs btn-info pull-right">1-2 pts</p>
        <p>
            If you scored one or two points, you might be noticing a couple of things in your relationship that are
            unhealthy, but it doesn’t necessarily mean they are warning signs. It’s still a good idea to keep an eye out
            and make sure there isn’t an unhealthy pattern developing.
            The best thing to do is to talk to your partner and let them know what you like and don’t like. Encourage
            them to do the same. Remember, communication is always important when building a healthy relationship.
            It’s also good to be informed so you can recognize the different types of abuse.

    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <p class="btn btn-xs btn-warning pull-right">3-4 pts</p>
        <p>
            If you scored three or four points, it sounds like you may be seeing some warning signs of an abusive
            relationship. Don’tignore these red flags. Something that starts small can grow much worse over time.
            No relationship is perfect -- it takes work! But in a healthy relationship you won’t find abusive behaviors.

    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <p class="btn btn-xs btn-danger pull-right">5 pts</p>
        <p>
            If you scored five or more points, you are definitely seeing warning signs and may be in an abusive relationship.
            Remember the most important thing is your safety -- consider making a safety plan.
